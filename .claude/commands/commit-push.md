# Commit and Push

Create a git commit with all current changes and push to the remote repository.

Follow the git commit workflow:
1. Run `git status` to see all changes
2. Run `git diff` to see the actual changes
3. Stage all relevant files (avoid staging sensitive files like .env)
4. Create a commit with a descriptive message
5. Push to the remote repository

Make sure to follow the standard commit message format from CLAUDE.md and include the Claude Code attribution.
