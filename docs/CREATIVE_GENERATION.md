# Creative Generation Integration

## Overview

The Creative Generation system transforms execution timelines into actionable creative briefs by automatically generating AI-ready image prompts and ad copy for each test combination. This enables:

- **Immediate value**: Clear creative direction for campaign execution
- **Future automation**: Direct integration with AI image generators (DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion)
- **Meta Ads ready**: Structured output compatible with Meta Marketing API

## Architecture

                                      [Per Test Combination]
                                       - Visual Prompt
                                       - Ad Copy
                                       - Hooks (5 variations)
                                       - Technical Specs
```

### Components

1. **`src/modules/creative_generator.py`**: Core creative prompt generation
2. **`src/modules/execution_planner.py`**: Integration point (enhances test combinations)
3. **`src/modules/campaign.py`**: Includes creative assets in final output
4. **`src/integrations/image_generator.py`**: Future text-to-image integration (stub)
5. **`src/integrations/meta_ads.py`**: Future Meta API deployment (stub)

## How It Works

### 1. Strategy-Driven Creative Generation

For each test combination in the execution timeline, the system generates creative prompts based on:

- **Platform requirements** (TikTok 9:16 vs Meta 1:1)
- **Audience segment** (Gen-Z vs Millennials ‚Üí different visual styles)
- **Messaging angle** from strategy (value-focused, urgency-driven, etc.)
- **Creative style** (UGC, lifestyle, product demo)
- **Brand guidelines** from user inputs

### 2. LLM-Powered Prompt Generation

**Temperature: 0.7** (balance creativity with brand consistency)

The LLM generates:
- **Visual prompt**: 50-150 word detailed description for AI image generation
- **Ad copy**: Platform-compliant copy (respects character limits)
- **Hooks**: 5 variations testing different psychological angles
- **Technical specs**: Platform-specific dimensions, aspect ratios, file formats

### 3. Platform-Specific Requirements

### Campaign Config with Creative Assets

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "campaign_name": "...",
    "daily_budget": 500,
    "targeting": {...}
  },
  "creative_assets": [

    }
  ]
}
```

## Usage

### Running the Agent

```bash
# Start agent with historical data
python cli.py run --project-id my-campaign-001

# Upload your historical campaign data
Files: data/historical_campaigns.csv
```

The agent will automatically:
1. Analyze historical data
2. Generate strategy with insights
3. Create execution timeline with phases
4. **Generate creative prompts for each test combination** ‚Üê New!
5. Output campaign configuration with creative assets

### Viewing Creative Prompts

The CLI displays creative prompts inline:

```
[1] SHORT-TERM DISCOVERY
    Test Combinations (3):
      [35%] Meta + Millennials 25-34 + UGC-style lifestyle
           ‚Üí Test authentic lifestyle imagery with aspirational messaging
           üì∏ Creative Brief:
              Visual: High-quality lifestyle photograph, 28-year-old woman...
              Copy: "Join 10,000+ women who transformed their mornings..."
              Headline: "Transform Your Mornings in 30 Days"
              CTA: SHOP_NOW
              Hooks: "What if your morning routine could change everything?" (+4 more)
              Specs: 1:1 | 1080x1080
```

At the end of the timeline:

```
üì∏ CREATIVE ASSETS SUMMARY:
  Total creative briefs generated: 6
  Platforms covered: Meta, TikTok
  Ready for AI image generation (DALL-E, Midjourney, etc.)
```

## Customization

### Brand Guidelines

Provide brand guidelines in your project to influence creative generation:

```python
# When creating project or uploading data
user_inputs = {
    "product_description": "30-day wellness program...",
    "brand_guidelines": """
        Brand Voice: Authentic, empowering, science-backed
        Visual Style: Natural lighting, real people, aspirational but relatable
        Color Palette: Warm earth tones, avoid neon/harsh colors
        Logo Placement: Bottom-right, subtle
        Avoid: Stock imagery, overly polished aesthetics
    """
}
```

This will be passed to the creative generator and influence:
- Visual prompt style descriptions
- Ad copy tone and messaging
- Technical specs (brand asset placement, color schemes)

### Platform Prioritization

The creative generator respects your strategy's platform priorities:

```json
{
  "platform_strategy": {
    "priorities": ["Meta", "TikTok"],
    "budget_split": {"Meta": 0.6, "TikTok": 0.4}
  }
}
```

Test combinations will be generated for prioritized platforms, with appropriate specs for each.

## Future Integrations

### 1. AI Image Generation

**Status**: Stub implemented in `src/integrations/image_generator.py`

**Planned workflow**:
```python
from src.integrations.image_generator import create_image_generator

# Initialize generator
generator = create_image_generator("dall-e", api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

# Generate images for all creative assets
for asset in config["creative_assets"]:
    creative = asset["creative_generation"]

    image_url = generator.generate(
        prompt=creative["visual_prompt"],
        specs=creative["technical_specs"]
    )

    # Store image URL/hash for ad deployment
    asset["generated_image"] = image_url
```

## Validation & Quality Control

### Automatic Validation

The system automatically validates each generated creative prompt:

‚úÖ **Required fields present**
- visual_prompt
- copy_primary_text
- copy_headline
- copy_cta
- hooks (minimum 3)
- technical_specs

‚úÖ **Platform compliance**
- Copy within character limits
- Dimensions match platform specs
- File format/size appropriate

‚úÖ **Hook diversity**
- At least 3 hook variations
- Different psychological angles

### Manual Review

Review generated creative prompts in:
1. **CLI output**: Inline display during execution
2. **Campaign config file**: `campaign_{project_id}_v{iteration}.json`
3. **Supabase database**: `experiment_plan` column in `projects` table

## Best Practices

### 1. Provide Detailed Brand Guidelines

**Good**:
```
Brand Voice: Authentic, empowering, science-backed
Visual Style: Natural lighting, real people (18-35), morning settings, indoor/outdoor mix
Color Palette: Warm earth tones (#D4A574, #8B7355), white backgrounds
Logo: Subtle placement bottom-right, 10% opacity
Avoid: Stock imagery, models, overly polished aesthetics, gym settings
```

**Bad**:
```
Brand: Modern and professional
```

### 2. Use Specific Product Descriptions

**Good**:
```
30-day wellness program combining morning routines, nutrition guidance, and mindfulness practices. Target: busy professionals (25-40) seeking sustainable lifestyle changes. Price: $49/month. Key differentiator: Science-backed routines that fit in 15 minutes.
```

**Bad**:
```
Wellness program
```

### 3. Review & Iterate

- Generated prompts are **starting points**, not final assets
- Test multiple hooks to find winning angles
- Adjust visual prompts based on generated image quality
- Refine copy based on platform performance

### 4. Platform-Native Aesthetics

The system generates platform-appropriate creative:
- **TikTok**: Authentic, UGC-style, vertical video aesthetic
- **Meta**: Polished lifestyle, aspirational but relatable
- **Google**: Clean, informative, benefit-focused

Trust these defaults, but customize if your brand demands it.

## Troubleshooting

### "Creative generation failed for combo_X"

**Cause**: LLM call failed or returned invalid JSON

**Solution**:
1. Check Gemini API key is valid: `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env`
2. Review error message in logs
3. Re-run agent (failure on single combo won't block entire flow)
4. Manual creative development required for failed combos

### "Validation warnings: Primary text exceeds 125 character limit"

**Cause**: LLM generated copy exceeding platform limits

**Solution**:
- This is just a warning - creative is still included
- Manually trim copy before deploying to platform
- Or add to brand guidelines: "Keep copy under 100 characters"

### "No creative assets in campaign config"

**Cause**: Execution plan missing or has no test combinations

**Solution**:
1. Verify execution timeline was generated: check `experiment_plan` in state
2. Ensure test combinations have `creative_generation` field
3. Check logs for creative generation step
