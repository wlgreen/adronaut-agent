## What's New in v24.0

The Meta Ads platform has introduced several major updates as of October 2025:

### Advantage+ Features (v23.0+)

**Audience Automation:**
- Meta's AI can now automatically expand your audience beyond your targeting
- Controlled by the `advantage_audience` setting (enabled by default)
- Typically improves performance by 10-20%

**Placement Optimization:**
- Meta can allocate up to 5% of budget to excluded placements if they perform well
- Called "Advantage+ placements" in Ads Manager

**Budget Flexibility:**
- Daily budgets can now flex up to 75% (previously 25%)
- Example: $100 daily budget can spend up to $175 on high-opportunity days
- Weekly spending still capped at 7x daily budget

### Creative Enhancements (v22.0+)

Meta now offers individual AI-powered creative improvements:
- **Enhance CTA**: Optimize call-to-action button placement
- **Image Brightness/Contrast**: Auto-adjust visuals for better performance
- **Text Enhancements**: AI-improved ad copy variations

These are opt-in features you'll see in the creative setup.

### Attribution Updates (June 2025)

**New Attribution Model:**
- On-Meta events (link clicks, page views): Attributed to impression time
- Off-Meta events (website purchases): Attributed to conversion time
- May see different conversion counts compared to older campaigns

### Important Notes

üö® **ASC/AAC Deprecation (Q1 2026):**
- Advantage+ Shopping Campaigns (ASC) and Advantage+ App Campaigns (AAC) are being phased out
- New unified Advantage+ system based on automation settings
- Your configs are already compatible with the new system

---

## Reading the Generated Config

Your config file contains a `meta` section with all the settings needed. Here's what each section means:

### Config Structure

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "campaign_name": "Eco Bottle - Phase 1 Discovery - Meta",
    "objective": "CONVERSIONS",
    "daily_budget": 300.0,
    "targeting": { ... },
    "placements": [ ... ],
    "bidding": { ... },
    "creative_specs": { ... },
    "optimization": { ... },
    "schedule": { ... }
  }
}
```

### Key Fields

- **campaign_name**: Name for your campaign
- **objective**: Marketing objective (see mapping below)
- **daily_budget**: Budget in dollars per day
- **targeting**: Who sees your ads
- **placements**: Where ads appear
- **bidding**: How much you're willing to pay
- **creative_specs**: Ad content guidelines
- **optimization**: What Meta optimizes for

---

## Campaign Setup

### Step 1: Navigate to Ads Manager

1. Go to [business.facebook.com/adsmanager](https://business.facebook.com/adsmanager)
2. Click the green **"Create"** button
3. Choose your ad account if prompted

### Step 2: Select Campaign Objective

Map the `objective` from your config to the Meta Ads Manager option:

| Config Value | Meta Ads Manager Selection | Notes |
|--------------|----------------------------|-------|
| `OUTCOME_SALES` or `CONVERSIONS` | **Sales** | E-commerce purchases (v24.0 standard) |
| `OUTCOME_TRAFFIC` | **Traffic** | Link clicks, landing page views |
| `OUTCOME_LEADS` | **Leads** | Lead form submissions |
| `OUTCOME_ENGAGEMENT` | **Engagement** | Post engagement, page likes |
| `OUTCOME_AWARENESS` | **Awareness** | Reach and impressions |

**Example**: If your config shows `"objective": "OUTCOME_SALES"`, select **Sales**.

**Note:** Older configs may show `CONVERSIONS` - this maps to **Sales** (Meta rebranded it in 2024).

### Step 3: Set Campaign Name

- Enter the `campaign_name` from your config
- Example: `Eco Bottle - Phase 1 Discovery - Meta`

### Step 4: Special Ad Categories (if applicable)

- If your product is in housing, employment, credit, or social issues, declare it
- Most e-commerce products: Leave unchecked
- Config field: `special_ad_categories` (usually empty: `[]`)

### Step 5: Advantage+ Campaign Settings (New in v23.0+)

You may see options for **Advantage+ campaign** features:

**Advantage+ Creative:**
- If enabled, Meta will test variations of your creative (text, images, CTA)
- Config may include `advantage_plus: true`
- Toggle **ON** if specified in config

**Budget Optimization:**
- Option to enable Campaign Budget Optimization (CBO)
- Config typically uses ad set budgets, so leave this **OFF**
- If config has `budget_rebalance: true`, enable **Budget Rebalancing**

### Step 6: Campaign Budget (Optional)

- You can set budget at campaign level or ad set level
- Config specifies ad set level budget, so skip this for now
- Click **Continue** to Ad Set setup

---

## Ad Set Configuration

This is where most of your config settings apply.

### Step 1: Ad Set Name

- Use: `<campaign_name> - Ad Set 1` or the name from config
- Example: `Eco Bottle - US - 25-44 - Sustainability`

### Step 2: Budget & Schedule

#### Daily Budget
- Find `daily_budget` in your config (in dollars)
- Enter this amount in the **Daily Budget** field
- Example: Config shows `300.0` ‚Üí Enter `$300.00`

**Budget Flexibility (v24.0+):**
- Meta can spend up to **175%** of daily budget on high-opportunity days
- Example: $300 daily budget ‚Üí Can spend up to $525 in one day
- Weekly total still capped at 7x daily budget ($2,100 for $300/day)
- No action needed - this is automatic

**Budget Sharing (v24.0+):**
```json
"enable_budget_sharing": true
```
- If enabled in config, toggle **Enable budget sharing between ad sets**
- Allows 20% of one ad set's budget to be used by others in same campaign
- Improves performance without Campaign Budget Optimization (CBO)

#### Schedule
- **Start Date**: Use `schedule.start_date` from config
  - Format: `2025-10-13` ‚Üí Set start date to October 13, 2025
- **End Date**:
  - If `schedule.end_date` is `null`: Select **No end date**
  - If specified: Set the end date

### Step 3: Audience Targeting

This is crucial - follow your config exactly.

#### Locations
```json
"targeting": {
  "locations": ["United States"]
}
```
- Click **Edit** next to Locations
- Search and add each location from the config
- Example: Type "United States", select, and add

#### Age
```json
"age_range": "25-44"
```
- Set **Age** dropdown to match
- Example: `25-44` ‚Üí Set Age from **25** to **44**

#### Gender
```json
"gender": "ALL"
```
- **ALL** ‚Üí Select "All genders"
- **1** ‚Üí Select "Men"
- **2** ‚Üí Select "Women"

#### Detailed Targeting

```json
"detailed_targeting": {
  "interests": [
    "Environmentalism",
    "Sustainable living",
    "Fitness and wellness"

}
```

**To add interests**:

- Behaviors often appear under "Demographics" or "Purchase Behavior" categories

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note (v24.0+):** Some detailed targeting options were consolidated starting October 8, 2025. If an interest isn't found, try:
- Broader related interests (e.g., "Environment" instead of "Environmentalism")
- Click **Browse** to see available categories
- Use Meta's Suggestions feature

#### Advantage Audience (v23.0+ - Important!)

```json
"advantage_audience": 1
```

**What is this?**
- Meta's AI can expand beyond your targeting to find better-performing audiences
- `1` = Enabled (recommended, typically improves performance)
- `0` = Disabled (strict targeting only)

**How to set it:**
1. Look for toggle: **Advantage+ audience** or **Audience expansion**

**New Attribution Model (June 2025):**
- **On-Meta events** (link clicks, page views, Facebook leads): Attributed to **impression time**
- **Off-Meta events** (website purchases, app installs): Attributed to **conversion time**
- This is automatic - no action needed, just be aware when comparing to older campaigns

### Step 6: Bidding Strategy

```json
"bidding": {
  "strategy": "LOWEST_COST_WITH_BID_CAP",
  "bid_amount": 32.0,
  "target_cpa": 25.0

---

## Amazon Attribution Specific

If you're sending traffic to Amazon (not your own site), follow these special instructions:

### Why It's Different
- You **cannot** install Meta Pixel on Amazon product pages
- Use **Amazon Attribution** for conversion tracking instead
- Meta can only track clicks and landing page views (not purchases)

### URL Format

Your config might include an Amazon Attribution URL like:

```
https://www.amazon.com/dp/<ASIN>/?tag=<assoc_tag>&aa-campaign=<CID>&aa-creative=<CRID>&utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=<CID>
```

**Key components**:
- `tag=<assoc_tag>`: Your Amazon Associates tag
- `aa-campaign=<CID>`: Amazon Attribution campaign ID
- `aa-creative=<CRID>`: Amazon Attribution creative ID
- UTM parameters: For Meta-side tracking

### Setup Steps

1. **Create Amazon Attribution Tag**:
   - Go to Amazon Attribution dashboard
   - Create a new tag for this campaign
   - Copy the full attribution URL

2. **Use Traffic Objective**:
   - Instead of **Sales**, select **Traffic** objective
   - Optimization goal: **Link Clicks** or **Landing Page Views**

3. **Enter Attribution URL** as destination:
   - Paste the full URL with all parameters
   - Store this exact URL for later reconciliation

4. **Measure Conversions in Amazon**:
   - Meta Insights: Shows link clicks, landing page views
   - Amazon Attribution Dashboard: Shows purchases, revenue
   - **Reconcile by campaign ID**: Match Meta's campaign/ad IDs with Amazon Attribution tags

### Config Differences for Amazon

```json
{
  "objective": "OUTCOME_TRAFFIC",  // Not CONVERSIONS
  "optimization": {
    "optimization_goal": "LINK_CLICKS",  // Not CONVERSIONS
    "billing_event": "IMPRESSIONS"
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors

#### "Targeting Too Specific"
- **Symptom**: Meta warns audience is too small (< 1,000 people)
- **Solution**:
  - Remove one or two interests
  - Expand age range slightly
  - Add more locations

#### "Budget Too Low for Selected Placements"
- **Symptom**: Meta recommends higher budget
- **Solution**:
  - Increase daily budget to at least $20-30/day
  - Or reduce number of placements
  - Use Meta's suggested minimum

#### "Ad Rejected - Image Contains Too Much Text"
- **Symptom**: Image violates text overlay policy
- **Solution**:
  - Use images with less than 20% text coverage
  - Remove text overlays from image
  - Use primary text field instead

#### "Pixel Event Not Found"
- **Symptom**: Purchase event not available
- **Solution**:
  - Verify Meta Pixel is installed on your website
  - Check that Purchase events are firing
  - Use Facebook Pixel Helper extension to test
  - For Amazon: Switch to Traffic objective with Link Clicks

#### "Custom Audience Unavailable"
- **Symptom**: Config references audience that doesn't exist
- **Solution**:
  - Create the custom audience first
  - Or skip and use interest targeting only
  - Update config for next iteration

### Budget Pacing Issues

**Symptom**: Budget spending too fast or too slow

- **Too Fast**:
  - Add bid cap (e.g., use `bid_amount` from config)
  - Narrow targeting
  - Reduce placements

- **Too Slow**:
  - Remove bid cap
  - Expand targeting
  - Check if objective aligns with website conversion rate

### Review Feedback

**If ad is rejected**, check feedback:

1. Click **Info** icon next to rejected ad
2. Read specific violation
3. Common violations:
   - **Before/After Images**: Not allowed
   - **Unrealistic Claims**: "Lose 20 lbs in 1 week"
   - **Personal Attributes**: Can't call out age, race, health
   - **Prohibited Content**: Weapons, tobacco, adult content
4. Edit ad to address issue
5. Resubmit for review
