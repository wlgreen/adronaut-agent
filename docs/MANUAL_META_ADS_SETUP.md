## What's New in v24.0

The Meta Ads platform has introduced several major updates as of October 2025:

### Advantage+ Features (v23.0+)

**Audience Automation:**
- Meta's AI can now automatically expand your audience beyond your targeting
- Controlled by the `advantage_audience` setting (enabled by default)
- Typically improves performance by 10-20%

**Placement Optimization:**
- Meta can allocate up to 5% of budget to excluded placements if they perform well
- Called "Advantage+ placements" in Ads Manager

**Budget Flexibility:**
- Daily budgets can now flex up to 75% (previously 25%)
- Example: $100 daily budget can spend up to $175 on high-opportunity days
- Weekly spending still capped at 7x daily budget

### Creative Enhancements (v22.0+)

Meta now offers individual AI-powered creative improvements:
- **Enhance CTA**: Optimize call-to-action button placement
- **Image Brightness/Contrast**: Auto-adjust visuals for better performance
- **Text Enhancements**: AI-improved ad copy variations

These are opt-in features you'll see in the creative setup.

### Attribution Updates (June 2025)

**New Attribution Model:**
- On-Meta events (link clicks, page views): Attributed to impression time
- Off-Meta events (website purchases): Attributed to conversion time
- May see different conversion counts compared to older campaigns

### Important Notes

🚨 **ASC/AAC Deprecation (Q1 2026):**
- Advantage+ Shopping Campaigns (ASC) and Advantage+ App Campaigns (AAC) are being phased out
- New unified Advantage+ system based on automation settings
- Your configs are already compatible with the new system

---

## Reading the Generated Config

Your config file contains a `meta` section with all the settings needed. Here's what each section means:

### Config Structure

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "campaign_name": "Eco Bottle - Phase 1 Discovery - Meta",
    "objective": "CONVERSIONS",
    "daily_budget": 300.0,
    "targeting": { ... },
    "placements": [ ... ],
    "bidding": { ... },
    "creative_specs": { ... },
    "optimization": { ... },
    "schedule": { ... }
  }
}
```

### Key Fields

- **campaign_name**: Name for your campaign
- **objective**: Marketing objective (see mapping below)
- **daily_budget**: Budget in dollars per day
- **targeting**: Who sees your ads
- **placements**: Where ads appear
- **bidding**: How much you're willing to pay
- **creative_specs**: Ad content guidelines
- **optimization**: What Meta optimizes for

---

## Campaign Setup

### Step 1: Navigate to Ads Manager

1. Go to [business.facebook.com/adsmanager](https://business.facebook.com/adsmanager)
2. Click the green **"Create"** button
3. Choose your ad account if prompted

### Step 2: Select Campaign Objective

Map the `objective` from your config to the Meta Ads Manager option:

| Config Value | Meta Ads Manager Selection | Notes |
|--------------|----------------------------|-------|
| `OUTCOME_SALES` or `CONVERSIONS` | **Sales** | E-commerce purchases (v24.0 standard) |
| `OUTCOME_TRAFFIC` | **Traffic** | Link clicks, landing page views |
| `OUTCOME_LEADS` | **Leads** | Lead form submissions |
| `OUTCOME_ENGAGEMENT` | **Engagement** | Post engagement, page likes |
| `OUTCOME_AWARENESS` | **Awareness** | Reach and impressions |

**Example**: If your config shows `"objective": "OUTCOME_SALES"`, select **Sales**.

**Note:** Older configs may show `CONVERSIONS` - this maps to **Sales** (Meta rebranded it in 2024).

### Step 3: Set Campaign Name

- Enter the `campaign_name` from your config
- Example: `Eco Bottle - Phase 1 Discovery - Meta`

### Step 4: Special Ad Categories (if applicable)

- If your product is in housing, employment, credit, or social issues, declare it
- Most e-commerce products: Leave unchecked
- Config field: `special_ad_categories` (usually empty: `[]`)

### Step 5: Advantage+ Campaign Settings (New in v23.0+)

You may see options for **Advantage+ campaign** features:

**Advantage+ Creative:**
- If enabled, Meta will test variations of your creative (text, images, CTA)
- Config may include `advantage_plus: true`
- Toggle **ON** if specified in config

**Budget Optimization:**
- Option to enable Campaign Budget Optimization (CBO)
- Config typically uses ad set budgets, so leave this **OFF**
- If config has `budget_rebalance: true`, enable **Budget Rebalancing**

### Step 6: Campaign Budget (Optional)

- You can set budget at campaign level or ad set level
- Config specifies ad set level budget, so skip this for now
- Click **Continue** to Ad Set setup

---

## Ad Set Configuration

This is where most of your config settings apply.

### Step 1: Ad Set Name

- Use: `<campaign_name> - Ad Set 1` or the name from config
- Example: `Eco Bottle - US - 25-44 - Sustainability`

### Step 2: Budget & Schedule

#### Daily Budget
- Find `daily_budget` in your config (in dollars)
- Enter this amount in the **Daily Budget** field
- Example: Config shows `300.0` → Enter `$300.00`

**Budget Flexibility (v24.0+):**
- Meta can spend up to **175%** of daily budget on high-opportunity days
- Example: $300 daily budget → Can spend up to $525 in one day
- Weekly total still capped at 7x daily budget ($2,100 for $300/day)
- No action needed - this is automatic

**Budget Sharing (v24.0+):**
```json
"enable_budget_sharing": true
```
- If enabled in config, toggle **Enable budget sharing between ad sets**
- Allows 20% of one ad set's budget to be used by others in same campaign
- Improves performance without Campaign Budget Optimization (CBO)

#### Schedule
- **Start Date**: Use `schedule.start_date` from config
  - Format: `2025-10-13` → Set start date to October 13, 2025
- **End Date**:
  - If `schedule.end_date` is `null`: Select **No end date**
  - If specified: Set the end date

### Step 3: Audience Targeting

This is crucial - follow your config exactly.

#### Locations
```json
"targeting": {
  "locations": ["United States"]
}
```
- Click **Edit** next to Locations
- Search and add each location from the config
- Example: Type "United States", select, and add

#### Age
```json
"age_range": "25-44"
```
- Set **Age** dropdown to match
- Example: `25-44` → Set Age from **25** to **44**

#### Gender
```json
"gender": "ALL"
```
- **ALL** → Select "All genders"
- **1** → Select "Men"
- **2** → Select "Women"

#### Detailed Targeting

```json
"detailed_targeting": {
  "interests": [
    "Environmentalism",
    "Sustainable living",
    "Fitness and wellness"
  ],
  "behaviors": [
    "Online shoppers",
    "Engaged shoppers"
  ]
}
```

**To add interests**:
1. Click in the **Detailed Targeting** field
2. Type the first interest: `Environmentalism`
3. Select from dropdown suggestions
4. Click **Suggestions** to see related interests
5. Repeat for all interests in the list

**To add behaviors**:
- Same process, search for each behavior
- Behaviors often appear under "Demographics" or "Purchase Behavior" categories

⚠️ **Note (v24.0+):** Some detailed targeting options were consolidated starting October 8, 2025. If an interest isn't found, try:
- Broader related interests (e.g., "Environment" instead of "Environmentalism")
- Click **Browse** to see available categories
- Use Meta's Suggestions feature

#### Advantage Audience (v23.0+ - Important!)

```json
"advantage_audience": 1
```

**What is this?**
- Meta's AI can expand beyond your targeting to find better-performing audiences
- `1` = Enabled (recommended, typically improves performance)
- `0` = Disabled (strict targeting only)

**How to set it:**
1. Look for toggle: **Advantage+ audience** or **Audience expansion**
2. If `advantage_audience: 1` in config → Toggle **ON**
3. If `advantage_audience: 0` in config → Toggle **OFF**

**Default (if not in config):** Leave ON (Meta's recommendation as of v23.0)

#### Language
```json
"language": "English"
```
- In **Languages** section, add `English (All)` if specified

#### Custom Audiences (if present)
```json
"custom_audiences": [
  "Website visitors (180 days)",
  "Lookalike 1% (Purchasers)"
]
```
- Click **Use Saved Audiences** or **Custom Audiences**
- Select the audiences listed
- *Note*: These must already exist in your account

### Step 4: Placements

```json
"placements": [
  "Facebook Feeds",
  "Instagram Feeds",
  "Instagram Stories",
  "Instagram Reels"
],
"enable_advantage_placement": true
```

**Placement Options:**

1. **Advantage+ Placements (Recommended for v24.0+)**:
   - If `enable_advantage_placement: true` in config
   - Select **Advantage+ placements**
   - Meta allocates up to 5% budget to excluded placements if they perform well
   - Best for Sales and Leads objectives

2. **Manual Placements**:
   - If you want strict control or config doesn't specify
   - Select **Manual Placements**
   - Uncheck **Automatic Placements**
   - Check only the placements listed in your config:
     - ✅ Facebook Feed
     - ✅ Instagram Feed
     - ✅ Instagram Stories
     - ✅ Instagram Reels
     - ❌ Uncheck all others (Marketplace, Right Column, etc.)

**Note:** Video feed placements are no longer supported as of v24.0.

### Step 5: Optimization & Delivery

#### Optimization Goal
```json
"optimization": {
  "optimization_goal": "CONVERSIONS",
  "conversion_window": "7_DAY_CLICK"
}
```

- **Performance Goal**: Select based on `optimization_goal`
  - `CONVERSIONS` → **Conversions** (Purchase events)
  - `LINK_CLICKS` → **Link Clicks**
  - `LANDING_PAGE_VIEWS` → **Landing Page Views**

#### Conversion Location
- Select **Website** (for e-commerce)
- Or **App** if applicable

#### Pixel Event (for Conversions objective)
- Select your Meta Pixel from dropdown
- Choose event: Usually **Purchase**
- Config field: `optimization.pixel_event`

#### Attribution Window (Updated June 2025)
```json
"conversion_window": "7_DAY_CLICK"
```
- Set Attribution Setting: **7-day click** or **7-day click, 1-day view**
- Match the window specified in config

**New Attribution Model (June 2025):**
- **On-Meta events** (link clicks, page views, Facebook leads): Attributed to **impression time**
- **Off-Meta events** (website purchases, app installs): Attributed to **conversion time**
- This is automatic - no action needed, just be aware when comparing to older campaigns

### Step 6: Bidding Strategy

```json
"bidding": {
  "strategy": "LOWEST_COST_WITH_BID_CAP",
  "bid_amount": 32.0,
  "target_cpa": 25.0
}
```

#### Bid Strategy Mapping

| Config Strategy | Meta Ads Manager Option |
|-----------------|-------------------------|
| `LOWEST_COST_WITHOUT_CAP` | **Highest volume** (no bid cap) |
| `LOWEST_COST_WITH_BID_CAP` | **Cost per result goal** (set bid cap) |

**Setting Bid Cap**:
1. If strategy is `LOWEST_COST_WITH_BID_CAP`:
   - Select **Cost per result goal**
   - Enter `bid_amount`: $32.00
2. Or use `target_cpa` if specified:
   - Enter target CPA: $25.00

#### Billing Event
```json
"billing_event": "IMPRESSIONS"
```
- Usually **Impressions** (default)
- Rarely changed - Meta will auto-select

### Step 7: Delivery Type
- Keep as **Standard** (default)
- Config doesn't specify otherwise

## Creative Setup

### Step 1: Select Format

```json
"creative_specs": {
  "formats": [
    "Video (9:16 for Stories/Reels, 1:1 for Feeds)",
    "Carousel (1:1) - backup format"
  ]
}
```

- Select **Create Ad** → Choose format
- **Video**: Upload video files
- **Single Image**: Upload image files
- **Carousel**: Add 2-10 images/videos

### Step 2: Upload Media

  - Duration: Check `creative_specs.duration` (e.g., "15-30 seconds")
- **For Images**:
  - Aspect ratio: Usually `1:1` (square) or `4:5` (vertical)
  - Resolution: At least 1080x1080 pixels

### Step 3: Ad Copy

#### Primary Text
```json
"messaging": [
  "Problem/Solution: Articulate the single-use plastic problem...",
  "Authenticity: Prioritize UGC-style video...",
  "Benefit-driven: Highlight 'Keeps drinks cold 24hrs'..."
]
```

- Use the `messaging` array as guidance
- Write copy that covers these themes
- Example:
  > "Tired of buying disposable bottles? Our eco-bottle lasts a lifetime and keeps drinks cold for 24 hours. Join 50,000+ wellness enthusiasts who made the switch. Shop now!"

**Advantage+ Text Enhancements (v22.0+):**
```json
"advantage_creative_enhancements": {
  "text_enhancements": true
}
```
- If enabled, look for **Text enhancements** toggle
- Meta will test variations of your copy
- Toggle **ON** to enable

#### Headline
```json
"name": "Fall Distance Sale"
```
- Enter the headline from `creative_specs.name` or craft one
- Example: `Fall Distance Sale`
- Keep under 40 characters for best display

#### Description (optional)
- Add more details if desired
- Shows on some placements

### Step 3b: Advantage+ Creative Enhancements (v22.0+)

Your config may specify individual creative enhancements:

```json
"advantage_creative_enhancements": {
  "enhance_cta": true,
  "image_brightness_and_contrast": true,
  "text_enhancements": true
}
```

**Available Enhancements:**

1. **Enhance CTA** (`enhance_cta`):
   - Optimizes call-to-action button placement and style
   - Toggle: **Enhance call to action**

2. **Image Brightness & Contrast** (`image_brightness_and_contrast`):
   - Auto-adjusts image quality for better performance
   - Toggle: **Optimize image brightness and contrast**

3. **Text Enhancements** (`text_enhancements`):
   - Tests variations of your ad copy
   - Toggle: **Text enhancements**

**How to enable:**
- In the creative setup, scroll to **Advantage+ creative**
- Toggle **ON** for each enhancement specified in config
- These are AI-powered and typically improve performance by 5-15%

### Step 4: Destination

```json
"link": "https://example.com/product"
```

- **Website URL**: Enter the `link` from your config
- **Display Link** (optional): Shorten URL for display
- **Call to Action**: Select from dropdown

#### Call to Action
```json
"call_to_action": {
  "type": "SHOP_NOW"
}
```

| Config CTA Type | Meta Dropdown Option |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| `SHOP_NOW` | Shop Now |
| `LEARN_MORE` | Learn More |
| `SIGN_UP` | Sign Up |

### Step 5: Tracking Parameters (Advanced)

- **UTM Parameters**: Add for tracking
  - `utm_source=facebook`
  - `utm_medium=cpc`
  - `utm_campaign=<campaign_name>`
- Some configs include these - check `link` field

---

## Amazon Attribution Specific

If you're sending traffic to Amazon (not your own site), follow these special instructions:

### Why It's Different
- You **cannot** install Meta Pixel on Amazon product pages
- Use **Amazon Attribution** for conversion tracking instead
- Meta can only track clicks and landing page views (not purchases)

### URL Format

Your config might include an Amazon Attribution URL like:

```
https://www.amazon.com/dp/<ASIN>/?tag=<assoc_tag>&aa-campaign=<CID>&aa-creative=<CRID>&utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=<CID>
```

**Key components**:
- `tag=<assoc_tag>`: Your Amazon Associates tag
- `aa-campaign=<CID>`: Amazon Attribution campaign ID
- `aa-creative=<CRID>`: Amazon Attribution creative ID
- UTM parameters: For Meta-side tracking

### Setup Steps

1. **Create Amazon Attribution Tag**:
   - Go to Amazon Attribution dashboard
   - Create a new tag for this campaign
   - Copy the full attribution URL

2. **Use Traffic Objective**:
   - Instead of **Sales**, select **Traffic** objective
   - Optimization goal: **Link Clicks** or **Landing Page Views**

3. **Enter Attribution URL** as destination:
   - Paste the full URL with all parameters
   - Store this exact URL for later reconciliation

4. **Measure Conversions in Amazon**:
   - Meta Insights: Shows link clicks, landing page views
   - Amazon Attribution Dashboard: Shows purchases, revenue
   - **Reconcile by campaign ID**: Match Meta's campaign/ad IDs with Amazon Attribution tags

### Config Differences for Amazon

```json
{
  "objective": "OUTCOME_TRAFFIC",  // Not CONVERSIONS
  "optimization": {
    "optimization_goal": "LINK_CLICKS",  // Not CONVERSIONS
    "billing_event": "IMPRESSIONS"
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors

#### "Targeting Too Specific"
- **Symptom**: Meta warns audience is too small (< 1,000 people)
- **Solution**:
  - Remove one or two interests
  - Expand age range slightly
  - Add more locations

#### "Budget Too Low for Selected Placements"
- **Symptom**: Meta recommends higher budget
- **Solution**:
  - Increase daily budget to at least $20-30/day
  - Or reduce number of placements
  - Use Meta's suggested minimum

#### "Ad Rejected - Image Contains Too Much Text"
- **Symptom**: Image violates text overlay policy
- **Solution**:
  - Use images with less than 20% text coverage
  - Remove text overlays from image
  - Use primary text field instead

#### "Pixel Event Not Found"
- **Symptom**: Purchase event not available
- **Solution**:
  - Verify Meta Pixel is installed on your website
  - Check that Purchase events are firing
  - Use Facebook Pixel Helper extension to test
  - For Amazon: Switch to Traffic objective with Link Clicks

#### "Custom Audience Unavailable"
- **Symptom**: Config references audience that doesn't exist
- **Solution**:
  - Create the custom audience first
  - Or skip and use interest targeting only
  - Update config for next iteration

### Budget Pacing Issues

**Symptom**: Budget spending too fast or too slow

- **Too Fast**:
  - Add bid cap (e.g., use `bid_amount` from config)
  - Narrow targeting
  - Reduce placements

- **Too Slow**:
  - Remove bid cap
  - Expand targeting
  - Check if objective aligns with website conversion rate

### Review Feedback

**If ad is rejected**, check feedback:

1. Click **Info** icon next to rejected ad
2. Read specific violation
3. Common violations:
   - **Before/After Images**: Not allowed
   - **Unrealistic Claims**: "Lose 20 lbs in 1 week"
   - **Personal Attributes**: Can't call out age, race, health
   - **Prohibited Content**: Weapons, tobacco, adult content
4. Edit ad to address issue
5. Resubmit for review

## Next Steps After Publishing

1. **Monitor Performance**:
   - Check Ads Manager daily for first 3-5 days
   - Look for: Impressions, link clicks, CPA, ROAS

2. **Upload Results to Agent**:
   - After 5-7 days, export performance data from Ads Manager
   - Upload to agent for reflection analysis
   - Agent will generate optimization recommendations

3. **Optimization Iterations**:
   - Agent creates "patch" configs for adjustments
   - Repeat this manual setup process with new settings
   - Continue testing and iterating

4. **Advantage+ Feature Performance**:
   - Monitor if Advantage+ audience expansion improved results
   - Check Ads Manager → Breakdown → Delivery to see expanded vs. original audience
   - Note creative enhancement performance in reporting
