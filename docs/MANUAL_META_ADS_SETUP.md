Before you begin, ensure you have:

### Config Structure

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "campaign_name": "Eco Bottle - Phase 1 Discovery - Meta",
    "objective": "CONVERSIONS",
    "daily_budget": 300.0,
    "targeting": { ... },
    "placements": [ ... ],
    "bidding": { ... },
    "creative_specs": { ... },
    "optimization": { ... },
    "schedule": { ... }
  }
}
```

### Key Fields

- **campaign_name**: Name for your campaign
- **objective**: Marketing objective (see mapping below)
- **daily_budget**: Budget in dollars per day
- **targeting**: Who sees your ads
- **placements**: Where ads appear
- **bidding**: How much you're willing to pay
- **creative_specs**: Ad content guidelines
- **optimization**: What Meta optimizes for

## Campaign Setup

### Step 1: Navigate to Ads Manager

1. Go to [business.facebook.com/adsmanager](https://business.facebook.com/adsmanager)
2. Click the green **"Create"** button
3. Choose your ad account if prompted

### Step 2: Select Campaign Objective

Map the `objective` from your config to the Meta Ads Manager option:

| Config Value | Meta Ads Manager Selection |
|--------------|----------------------------|
| `CONVERSIONS` or `OUTCOME_SALES` | **Sales** (formerly Conversions) |
| `OUTCOME_TRAFFIC` | **Traffic** |
| `OUTCOME_LEADS` | **Leads** |
| `OUTCOME_ENGAGEMENT` | **Engagement** |
| `OUTCOME_AWARENESS` | **Awareness** |

**Example**: If your config shows `"objective": "CONVERSIONS"`, select **Sales**.

### Step 3: Set Campaign Name

- Enter the `campaign_name` from your config
- Example: `Eco Bottle - Phase 1 Discovery - Meta`

### Step 4: Special Ad Categories (if applicable)

- If your product is in housing, employment, credit, or social issues, declare it
- Most e-commerce products: Leave unchecked
- Config field: `special_ad_categories` (usually empty: `[]`)

### Step 5: Campaign Budget (Optional)

- You can set budget at campaign level or ad set level
- Config specifies ad set level budget, so skip this for now

---

## Ad Set Configuration

This is where most of your config settings apply.

### Step 1: Ad Set Name

- Use: `<campaign_name> - Ad Set 1` or the name from config

### Step 2: Budget & Schedule

- **Start Date**: Use `schedule.start_date` from config
  - Format: `2025-10-13` → Set start date to October 13, 2025

  - If `schedule.end_date` is `null`: Select **No end date**
  - If specified: Set the end date

### Step 3: Audience Targeting

This is crucial - follow your config exactly.

## Creative Setup

### Step 1: Select Format

  ]
}
```

- Select **Create Ad** → Choose format
- **Video**: Upload video files
- **Single Image**: Upload image files
- **Carousel**: Add 2-10 images/videos

### Step 2: Upload Media

- **For Video**:
  - Recommended specs from config: `9:16` for Stories/Reels, `1:1` for Feeds
  - Duration: Check `creative_specs.duration` (e.g., "15-30 seconds")
- **For Images**:
  - Aspect ratio: Usually `1:1` (square) or `4:5` (vertical)
  - Resolution: At least 1080x1080 pixels

### Step 3: Ad Copy

#### Primary Text
```json
"messaging": [
  "Problem/Solution: Articulate the single-use plastic problem...",
  "Authenticity: Prioritize UGC-style video...",
  "Benefit-driven: Highlight 'Keeps drinks cold 24hrs'..."
]
```

- Use the `messaging` array as guidance
- Write copy that covers these themes
- Example:
  > "Tired of buying disposable bottles? Our eco-bottle lasts a lifetime and keeps drinks cold for 24 hours. Join 50,000+ wellness enthusiasts who made the switch. Shop now!"

#### Headline
```json
"name": "Fall Distance Sale"
```

- Shows on some placements

### Step 4: Destination

```json

  - `utm_campaign=<campaign_name>`
- Some configs include these - check `link` field

---

## Amazon Attribution Specific

If you're sending traffic to Amazon (not your own site), follow these special instructions:

### Why It's Different
- You **cannot** install Meta Pixel on Amazon product pages
- Use **Amazon Attribution** for conversion tracking instead
- Meta can only track clicks and landing page views (not purchases)

### URL Format

Your config might include an Amazon Attribution URL like:

```
https://www.amazon.com/dp/<ASIN>/?tag=<assoc_tag>&aa-campaign=<CID>&aa-creative=<CRID>&utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=<CID>
```

**Key components**:
- `tag=<assoc_tag>`: Your Amazon Associates tag
- `aa-campaign=<CID>`: Amazon Attribution campaign ID
- `aa-creative=<CRID>`: Amazon Attribution creative ID
- UTM parameters: For Meta-side tracking

### Setup Steps

1. **Create Amazon Attribution Tag**:
   - Go to Amazon Attribution dashboard
   - Create a new tag for this campaign
   - Copy the full attribution URL

2. **Use Traffic Objective**:
   - Instead of **Sales**, select **Traffic** objective
   - Optimization goal: **Link Clicks** or **Landing Page Views**

3. **Enter Attribution URL** as destination:
   - Paste the full URL with all parameters
   - Store this exact URL for later reconciliation

4. **Measure Conversions in Amazon**:
   - Meta Insights: Shows link clicks, landing page views
   - Amazon Attribution Dashboard: Shows purchases, revenue
   - **Reconcile by campaign ID**: Match Meta's campaign/ad IDs with Amazon Attribution tags

### Config Differences for Amazon

```json
{
  "objective": "OUTCOME_TRAFFIC",  // Not CONVERSIONS
  "optimization": {
    "optimization_goal": "LINK_CLICKS",  // Not CONVERSIONS
    "billing_event": "IMPRESSIONS"
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors

#### "Targeting Too Specific"
- **Symptom**: Meta warns audience is too small (< 1,000 people)
- **Solution**:
  - Remove one or two interests
  - Expand age range slightly
  - Add more locations

#### "Budget Too Low for Selected Placements"
- **Symptom**: Meta recommends higher budget
- **Solution**:
  - Increase daily budget to at least $20-30/day
  - Or reduce number of placements
  - Use Meta's suggested minimum

#### "Ad Rejected - Image Contains Too Much Text"
- **Symptom**: Image violates text overlay policy
- **Solution**:
  - Use images with less than 20% text coverage
  - Remove text overlays from image
  - Use primary text field instead

#### "Pixel Event Not Found"
- **Symptom**: Purchase event not available
- **Solution**:
  - Verify Meta Pixel is installed on your website
  - Check that Purchase events are firing
  - Use Facebook Pixel Helper extension to test
  - For Amazon: Switch to Traffic objective with Link Clicks

#### "Custom Audience Unavailable"
- **Symptom**: Config references audience that doesn't exist
- **Solution**:
  - Create the custom audience first
  - Or skip and use interest targeting only
  - Update config for next iteration

### Budget Pacing Issues

**Symptom**: Budget spending too fast or too slow

- **Too Fast**:
  - Add bid cap (e.g., use `bid_amount` from config)
  - Narrow targeting
  - Reduce placements

- **Too Slow**:
  - Remove bid cap
  - Expand targeting
  - Check if objective aligns with website conversion rate

### Review Feedback

**If ad is rejected**, check feedback:

1. Click **Info** icon next to rejected ad
2. Read specific violation
3. Common violations:
   - **Before/After Images**: Not allowed
   - **Unrealistic Claims**: "Lose 20 lbs in 1 week"
   - **Personal Attributes**: Can't call out age, race, health
   - **Prohibited Content**: Weapons, tobacco, adult content
4. Edit ad to address issue
5. Resubmit for review

---

## Next Steps After Publishing

1. **Monitor Performance**:
   - Check Ads Manager daily for first 3-5 days
   - Look for: Impressions, link clicks, CPA, ROAS

2. **Upload Results to Agent**:
   - After 5-7 days, export performance data from Ads Manager
   - Upload to agent for reflection analysis
   - Agent will generate optimization recommendations

3. **Optimization Iterations**:
   - Agent creates "patch" configs for adjustments
   - Repeat this manual setup process with new settings
   - Continue testing and iterating
