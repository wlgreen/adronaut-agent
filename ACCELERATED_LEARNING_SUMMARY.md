# Accelerated Learning Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

Successfully implemented **7-day parallel testing** to replace 21-day sequential testing, reducing learning time by **66%**.

### Changes Made

#### 1. **src/modules/insight.py**
- Updated `INSIGHT_PROMPT_TEMPLATE` (lines 73-90)
- Changed from "3 sequential experiments" to "parallel testing"
- Updated JSON structure from `week_1/week_2/week_3` to `day_1_to_7` with test matrix
- Added instructions for memory-based optimization and statistical requirements

#### 2. **src/modules/accelerated_learning.py** (NEW)
- `validate_parallel_experiment_plan()`: Validates plan structure and budgets
- `calculate_statistical_requirements()`: Ensures sufficient sample size (15+ conversions)
- `format_combination_label()`: Creates readable labels for combinations
- `extract_combination_summary()`: Extracts key info for display
- `compare_sequential_vs_parallel()`: Calculates time savings

#### 3. **cli.py**
- Added `print_accelerated_experiment_plan()` (lines 252-356)
- Displays combination matrix, hypotheses, decision criteria, evaluation schedule
- Shows memory-based optimizations (what's being skipped/tested)
- Backward compatible with sequential plans

#### 4. **CLAUDE.md**
- Updated with accelerated learning documentation (lines 168-209)
- Explains how the feature works and key files

#### 5. **docs/ACCELERATED_LEARNING.md** (NEW)
- Complete feature documentation
- Usage examples and technical details

#### 6. **tests/test_accelerated_learning.py** (NEW)
- Unit tests for all helper functions
- **All tests passing ‚úì**

## üéØ How It Works

### Before (Sequential - 21 days)
```
Week 1: Platform test ‚Üí Choose winner
Week 2: Audience test ‚Üí Choose winner
Week 3: Creative test ‚Üí Choose winner
```

### After (Parallel - 7 days)
```
Day 1-7: Test 4-6 combinations simultaneously
  - TikTok + Interest + UGC (30%)
  - TikTok + Lookalike + UGC (25%)
  - Meta + Interest + Testimonial (20%)
  - TikTok + Broad + Demo (15%)
  - Meta + Lookalike + UGC (10%)

Day 7: Choose winning combination
```

## üß™ Testing

### Unit Tests (Completed ‚úÖ)
```bash
python3 tests/test_accelerated_learning.py
```

**Result:**
```
============================================================
  ‚úì ALL TESTS PASSED
============================================================
```

All 5 test suites passed:
- ‚úì Validation tests
- ‚úì Statistical calculation tests
- ‚úì Label formatting tests
- ‚úì Summary extraction tests
- ‚úì Comparison tests

### Integration Test (Ready)

To test with actual agent and historical data:

```bash
# Run agent with historical data
python cli.py run --project-id test-accelerated-001

# Upload your historical CSV when prompted
# Should see "EXPERIMENT PLAN (7 DAYS - PARALLEL TESTING)"
```

---

## üìä Impact

### Time Savings
- **Before**: 21 days (3 weeks √ó 7 days)
- **After**: 7 days
- **Reduction**: 66% (14 days saved)
- **Learning speed**: 3x faster

### Statistical Rigor
- Same confidence level (90%)
- 15-20 conversions per combination
- Proper sample size validation

---

## üîÑ Backward Compatibility

‚úÖ **Fully backward compatible**

- Old plans with `week_1`, `week_2`, `week_3` still work
- Display function auto-detects format based on `mode` field
- No breaking changes to existing workflows

---

## üìÅ Files Added/Modified

- `src/modules/accelerated_learning.py` (182 lines)
- `docs/ACCELERATED_LEARNING.md` (300+ lines)
