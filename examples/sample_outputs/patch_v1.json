Meta's failure with Lookalike audience suggests the issue is platform-specific, not audience-specific. By reallocating Meta budget to scale the TikTok winner, we expect to reduce blended CPA from $25.8 to $22-23 while maintaining total conversion volume. Meta remains in the mix with 21% budget using TikTok's winning targeting/creative to test if format is the differentiator.",
