## The Core Problem

The system generates **technically sound but strategically weak campaigns** because:

1. **Insights are generic** - "Platform X works better" not "Why X works better"
2. **Strategy lacks structure** - No testable hypotheses, no confidence scoring
3. **Optimization is reactive** - Addresses symptoms, not root causes
4. **No benchmarking** - Can't tell if campaigns are good or bad
5. **Missing rigor** - No statistical significance, confidence levels, or sample size checks

**Result**: Campaigns perform in the **40-60th percentile** (mediocre), not **80-95th percentile** (excellent)
